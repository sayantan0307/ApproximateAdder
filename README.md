# Approximate_Adder
Verilog code for designing an approximate adder:
The repository contains the verilog code for designing a high accuracy approximate adder, based on the paper "A high-accuracy approximate adder with correct sign calculation" (DOI link- https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vlsi.2017.09.003). 
The code is for the implementation of the proposed adder (a 12-bit implementation has been done) with error correction.
